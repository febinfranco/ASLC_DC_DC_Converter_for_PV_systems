# ASLC DC-DC Converter for PV systems
A high step-up DC-DC converter with active switched LC-network is proposed in this project, which can be used in the photovoltaic (PV) system as the front-end stage to generate the required dc bus voltage. The proposed converter is simulated using MATLAB Simulink environment.
